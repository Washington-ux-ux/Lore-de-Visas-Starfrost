                <blockquote>In a space where everything is enveloped in deep darkness, a glitter indescribable as a birth nor an ending burst open.</blockquote>

                <p>Many flashes of lights start to shine in the empty realm. Over time, the various flares stabilize and take solidified forms, seemingly forming multiple planets. It is then that a blue flash of light starts to move, converging towards a green spark.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 1: Primitive Planet Reichphobia, the Fourth Broken World</h2>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/PrimitivePlanetReichphobia.png" alt="Imagem do Primitive planet Reichphobia">

                <p>On the spark of green, crude beasts form from the most primal emotion, fear. These primal and primitive beings are in a constant and primal battle for dominance. The ruler of these beasts encourages this competition, all in an effort for evolution and growth.</p>

                <p>The Scareclaw EARTH-attribute Beasts are all based on various irrational fears:</p>
                <img src="/assets/imagens/scareclaw-acro.webp">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/scareclaw-astra.webp">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/scareclar-belone.jpg">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/scareclaw-reichheart.jpg">

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scareclaw Acro</strong> - Acrophobia, fear of heights, characterized by its wings</li>
                    <li><strong>Scareclaw Astra</strong> - Astraphobia, fear of thunder and lightning, characterized by the orbs emitting lightning</li>
                    <li><strong>Scareclaw Belone</strong> - Belonephobia, fear of sharp objects, characterized by it's use of needles.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Scareclaw Reichheart is not a part of this pattern, and is named after the German word for empire or realm. The Field Spell's name is a portmanteau of this and -phobia, relating to the monsters' theme of irrational fears.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/scareclaw-sclash.jpg" alt="imagem do Tri-Heart derrotado">
                <p>Out of nowhere, a blue form appears from the sky and lands near Reichheart. As the form approaches, a man with a strange right arm and with an appearance near identical to Reichheart emerges. Reichheart, out of pure instinct, knew that man's purpose for being here was to capture him.</p>

                <p>Gathering all of the fear and sense of ego available to him, Reichheart evolves into an abomination, Scareclaw Tri-Heart in order to fend off the otherworldly intruder. Eventually, the power of Tri-Heart proves to not be enough to overpower his other self, and the unkown man comes out on top. As a result, the weakened Reichheart becomes absorbed into the man's right arm.</p>

                <p>As if absorbing Reichheart's sense of self, the man gains a light in his eyes. He begins to remember what he previously could not and comes to a realization. He was a being whose emotions have been split into other beings, the Hearts, separate but connected, and that his name was Visas Starfrost.</p>

                <p>In order to regain his lost self, Visas sets out on a journey and the Scareclaw beasts bid their new king farewell.</p>

                <p>Visas travels through the open space searching for his next destination. Hearing a voice, Visas finds Reichheart with him, this time in the form of Scareclaw Light-Heart. The chibi-like form of Reichheart leads Visas to his next destination, the Primeval Planet Perlereino.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-kitkallos.jpg" alt="imaegem da Kitkallos">

                <p>As Visas arrives on the spark of blue, he comes across three mermaids. Seemingly fearful of his presence, the inhabitants of the land explain that Visas resembles their lord, who has been after their pearls, their tears. It seems that the mermaids are under the control of Tearlaments Reinoheart, who then appears with the mermaid princess Tearlaments Kitkallos.</p>

                <p>The Tearlaments DARK-attribute Aqua monsters are all based on mermaid-like beings from European mythology and folklore:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tearlaments Merrli</strong> - French Melusine and Irish Merrow</li>
                    <li><strong>Tearlaments Havnis</strong> - Danish Havfrue</li>
                    <li><strong>Tearlaments Scheiren</strong> - Greek Siren.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Tearlaments Reinoheart's name comes from the Spanish/Portuguese word for kingdom, with the Field Spell combining it with the French word for pearl.</p>


                <p>The archetype takes inspiration from The Little Mermaid, and Tearlaments Kitkallos stems from the Chaetoceros, a type of marine plankton commonly found in sea foam (according to The Little Mermaid, mermaids turn into sea foam upon death).</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-sulliek.png" alt="Reinoheart chicoteando as tearlaments">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-kalleido-heart.jpg" alt="imagem do kalleido-heart">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-rulkallos.jpg" alt="imagem da rulkallos">

                <p>Reinoheart does not take kindly to the mermaids speaking to Visas. Viewing it as a sign of betrayal, he whips out at Kitkallos and the other mermaids and transforms into the abomination, Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart, brainwashing the girls with his power over sorrow and forcing them to fight alongside him.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-cryme.jpg" alt="imagem do Visas enfrentando kalleido-heart">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-griefs.jpg" alt="imagem do visas e da Rulkallos enfrentando kalleido-heart">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-heartbeat.jpg" alt="imagem do Visas vencendo a luta">

                <p>Visas struggles to fight Kaleido-Heart, as he does not want to harm the mermaids. In a pinch, Light-heart reminds Visas of his newfound power that he absorbed from Reichheart: the control over fear. Using that power to amplify Tearlaments Kitkallos' latent fear, the latter's emotions are overwhelmed. The fear overwrites the effect of Reinoheart's brainwashing, and she evolves into Tearlaments Rulkallos.</p>

                <p>This transformation into Rulkallos catches Kaleido-Heart off guard, and the two defeat Kaleido-Heart. Visas then readies himself to absorb the now weakened Reinoheart, hoping to regain another piece of himself. Suddenly, a red flash flickers from behind Visas and Reinoheart is nowhere to be seen.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-scream.jpg" alt="imagem do unicorn aparecendo para sequestrar reinoheart">

                <p>The source of the commotion appears. As part of the advance force of the Kashtira army, Kashtira Unicorn appears to kidnap Reinoheart. And as soon as they made their appearance known, they had managed to retreat.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/tearlaments-perlegia.jpg" alt="imagem das Tearlaments livres">

                <p>Free from the locks of Reinoheart and his tyrannical rule, Scheiren, Merrli, and Havnis are free to act as they wish. However, their new queen is nowhere to be seen...</p>

                <p>Attempting to follow Unicorn, Visas and Light-Heart make their way back to Primitive Planet Reichphobia. What they see horrifies Light-Heart. Now unrecognizable, the green planet has been dyed red, colonized by the Kashtira. Visas approaches the massive machine, Kashtira Shangri-Ira, and fends off the many soldiers of the Kashtira force. As the forces retreat even further and a container is passed on, Visas approaches a bright red planet.</p>

               
                <p>The first 3 Kashtira Psychic monsters are a part of the advance force and all based on legendary creatures. Interestingly, their names combine to form UFO.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kashtira Unicorn</strong> - mythical stallions with records from the most ancient civilizations, Unicorns</li>
                    <li><strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong> - a monstrosity in the form of a wolf from Norse mythology, the Fenrir</li>
                    <li><strong>Kashtira Ogre</strong> - cruel giants originating from Arthurian tales, Ogres.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The latter 2 Main Deck Kashtira monsters are corrupted forms of the Scareclaw Beasts and Tearlaments Kitkallos, overwhelmed by the colonial forces invading their respective homelands and forced to accept new, mechanical forms.</p>

                <p>On the spark of red, a crimson form approaches Visas. Kashtira Riseheart receives Reinoheart from Unicorn. With the assistance of an unnatural apparatus and a starry left arm, the form of anger absorbs sorrow, mimicking how the empty shell absorbed fear. This silhouette swiftly expands, evolving Riseheart into the intimidating Kashtira Arise-Heart.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/scareclaw-defanging.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Visas and Arise-Heart clash. Initially evenly matched, Arise-Heart's left arm starts to absorb Light-Heart. It seems that the tides are not in favor of Visas, now up against the power of three stemming from three Hearts; anger, fear, and sorrow.</p>

                <p>However, Light-Heart had left Visas a few parting words.</p>

                <blockquote>"Steal the power of the stars themselves."</blockquote>

                <p>Directly harnessing the planets, Visas' arm rapidly begins to expand and he could feel the three powers inside him. Visas' right arm and Arise-Heart's left clash and emits a blinding light. Visas emerges victorious and Rise-Heart gets absorbed by Visas, bringing with him control over anger, sorrow, and fear. However, Visas' arm begins to mutate...</p>

                <h2>Chapter 4: Peaceful Planet Calarium, the Fifth Broken World</h2>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/vicious-astraloud.jpg" alt="">

                <p>The various emotions within Visas seems to be too much for his mind to handle and the fusion between Visas and the three Hearts results in the abominable Vicious Astraloud. Negative emotions overwhelm Visas' consciousness and the being that is Vicious starts destroying the known realms.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/maddanium-imagining.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/mannadium-riumheart.jpg" alt="">

                <img src="/assets/imagens/mannadium-torrid.jpg" alt="">

                <p>Deep within Visas' mind, a powerful tree tries to suppress the overwhelming powers of fear, sorrow, and anger. Guarding this tree is Mannadium Riumheart. By gathering various negative emotions, the Calarium tree is able to transform them into fruits of joy, the Mannadium.</p>

                <p>The Mannadium Fairy Tuner monsters are all based on the previous planetary Field Spells and reflect the themes of the archetype/emotion they signify.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>mannadium fearless</strong> - contains a miniature Primitive Planet Reichphobia and is EARTH-attribute, mirroring fear and Scareclaw</li>
                    <li><strong>Mannadium Meek</strong> -  contains a miniature Primeval Planet Perlereino and is WATER-attribute, mirroring sorrow and Tearlaments</li>
                    <li><strong>Mannadium Torrid</strong> - contains a miniature Pressured Planet Wraitsoth and is FIRE-attribute, mirroring anger and Kashtira.</li>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/mannadium prime-heart.jpg" alt="">

                <p>Entering Visas' consciousness, Vicious approaches Riumheart's realm and brings about destruction within it. The central tree begins to collapse and using the last of its energy, the Mannadium fruits are entrusted to Riumheart, allowing him to evolve into Mannadium Prime-Heart.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/mannadium-reframing.jpg" alt="">
                <img src="/assets/imagens/mannadium-breakheart.jpg" alt="">

                <p>With this surge of energy, Prime-Heart tries to merge himself with Vicious. By doing so, he hoped to restore Visas' sense of self, his ego. With a momentous kick, he injected his powers of joy and self-confidence into Vicious, the monster had started to calm down. But before Visas regained complete control over his own body, the depleted Riumheart was struck down.</p>

                <img src="/assets/imagens/a-shattered-colorless-realm.jpg" alt="">

                <p>The introduction of various emotions overwhelmed the once empty shell. Unable to hold itself stable, Visas' mind and soul had started to crumble.</p>

                <blockquote>Amidst this shattering realm, Visas was forced to make one final decision.</blockquote>

                <p>This storyline has yet to be completed, and has several new characters and events depicted in cards debuting in Duelist Nexus, Age of Overlord, and beyond. Official confirmation of how each event played out will likely not be revealed until the eventual release of The Valuable Book EX4.</p>
